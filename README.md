Groq Chat with Permanent Memory Summary and tool calling (PMS+TC)

This system encapsulates the concept of what I call the Tapestry Engine. Just like humans have memories of summaries of evernts, we summarize every discussion, and restore it upon any new conversation.

We can compress individual summaries into a day's worth of summary because tokens are limited. We can compress daily summaries into weekly, daily and weekly into monthly, quartely, yearly, etc...

Function calling currently calls a test function, a get time function and a get weather function.

The memory view will have a calendar look and feel.
